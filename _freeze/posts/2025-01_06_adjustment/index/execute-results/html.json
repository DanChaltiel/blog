Less known is the collider bias, although its effect should not be underestimated.\n\nWhen dealing with confusion bias, the usual way is to adjust on confounding variables. However, adjusting on a collider is precisely what causes the collider bias.\n\n::: callout-tip\nI highly recommend Harvard's [\"Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions\"](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions) free online course. It explains DAGs and uses them to illustrates all kinds of biases.\n:::\n\nIn this post, we will simulate data and illustrate how those biases happen, and how strong they can be depending on different parameters.\n\n## Scenarios\n\nLet's take a simple case: you want to measure the association between `Y` (binary) and `X` (continuous), and your dataset contains another variable `Z` (continuous) correlated to `X`.\n\nWe will consider 3 causal scenarios, in which we are interested in the relationship between `X` and `Y`, with `X` being correlated with `Z`:\n\n-   **Scenario 1:** `Y` is caused by `X` alone (regardless of `Z`), there is no bias.\\\n    *Example*: `Y` is cancer, `X` is smoking, and `Z` is consumption of coffee.\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-align: center\n%%| echo: false\nflowchart LR\n    X -->|?| Y[Y=1]\n    Z <--> X\n    style X fill:#e8f2fc,stroke:#2986e9\n    style Y fill:#f4e3f3,stroke:#c160c1\n    style Z fill:#dff6f4,stroke:#44d4c4\n```\n\n\n\n-   **Scenario 2:** `Y` is caused by `X` and `Z`, there can be confounding bias and you probably should adjust on `Z`.\\\n    *Example*: `Y` is cancer, `X` is smoking, and `Z` is non-healthy behaviour (e.g. measured by diet quality).\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-align: center\n%%| echo: false\nflowchart LR\n    X -->|?| Y[Y=1]\n    Z <--> X\n    Z --> Y\n    style X fill:#e8f2fc,stroke:#2986e9\n    style Y fill:#f4e3f3,stroke:#c160c1\n    style Z fill:#dff6f4,stroke:#44d4c4\n```\n\n\n\n-   **Scenario 3:** `Y` is caused by `X`, and `Z` is caused by `X` and `Y`, there is a collider bias if you adjust on `Z`.\\\n    *Example*: `Y` is cancer, `X` is smoking, and `Z` is pulmonary infection.\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-align: center\n%%| echo: false\nflowchart LR\n    X -->|?| Y[Y=1]\n    Y --> Z\n    X <--> Z\n    style X fill:#e8f2fc,stroke:#2986e9\n    style Y fill:#f4e3f3,stroke:#c160c1\n    style Z fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#ffc61b\n```\n\n\n\n::: callout-important\nHere, I used a double arrow to note a simple association. `Z` could cause `X`, `X` could cause `Z`, or an unknown factor `W` could cause `X` and `Z`. This is not usual in DAGs which should be acyclical.\n:::\n\n## Simulation\n\nTo simulate this, we will need to:\n\n1)  generate datasets with the appropriate correlation structure\n2)  apply a logistic regression on each and save the right attributes\n3)  cross every possible scenario to have a good coverage of the problem\n\n### Data simulation function\n\nOK so first, we have to build a function that can simulate a dataset along these 3 scenarios.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Disclaimer\"}\nThe following code was inspired by the one published as supplemental material in [the article of Paul H. Lee in Sci Rep](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fsrep06085), many thanks to the author.\n:::\n\nThis code generates:\n\n-   `X` as a normally distributed vector\n-   `Z` as a normally distributed vector with a fixed correlation to `X`.\n-   `Y` as a binary vector that represents the outcome of a logistic regression influenced by `X` with coefficient `beta_x` (and `Z` with coefficient `beta_z` in the \"confounding\" scenario).\n\nThe only exception is in the \"collider\" scenario, where `Z` is generated (using [this code](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/313138/81974)) so it has a fixed correlation to both `X` and `Y`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Expand here for `data_sim()` code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ninvlogit = function(x) 1/(1+exp(-x)) #inverse-logit function\n\ndata_sim = function(N, correlation, beta_x=0.2, beta_z=0.2, \n                    type=c(\"no_bias\", \"confounding\", \"collider\"),\n                    seed=NULL){\n  if(!is.null(seed)) set.seed(seed)\n  type = match.arg(type)\n  x = rnorm(N)\n  if(type==\"no_bias\"){\n    #

confounder that we don't adjust on (overestimation in this case)\n-   When there is a collider that we adjust on (underestimation in this case)\n\nThe error is directly dependant on the correlation between `X` and `Z`, with a linear trend for the non-adjusted confounder and a non-linear trend for the adjusted collider.\n\nNote that we should probably not extrapolate on the functional form of this latter non-linear trend, as it is most likely dependant on the correlation structure in our simulation rather than on the type of bias. In our collider scenario, `Z` is correlated with both `X` and `Y`. In the original paper, the author used `z <- rnorm(sample_size) + cor_x_z*x + y`, and it didn't show this kind of pattern.\n\n### Error on `X` depending on effect of `Z`\n\nIf we fix coefficient `beta_x` to 0.2, we can now vary `beta_x` to see the difference in bias magnitude.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_coef %>% \n  filter(beta_x==0.2, sample_size==500) %>%\n  filter(scenario==\"Confounder - Bare model\" | scenario==\"Collider - Adjusted model\") %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x=correlation) +\n  geom_col(aes(y=x_coef_mean_error), \n           position=pd, alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(y=x_coef_median_error, ymin=x_coef_pc25_error, ymax=x_coef_pc75_error), \n                  position=pd) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0, alpha=0.3) +\n  facet_grid(scenario~effect_z, scales=\"free_y\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1), labels=scales::label_percent()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::label_percent()) +\n  labs(x=\"Correlation between X and Z\", y=\"Relative error on X coefficient\", \n       color=\"Sample size\", fill=\"Sample size\",\n       caption=capt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-coef-effect-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs expected, in both cases, there is more bias when the confounder/collider `Z` has a greater effect on `Y` than `X`.\n\n## Results: `p-values`\n\n### Data\n\nSame as before, we need to wrangle our data into a workable dataframe. Here, I'm using `prop.test` to get the confidence interval of the proportion of significant p-values at alpha=5%. Then I'm painfuly unnesting and unpacking into nice columns.\n\nWe set the hypothesis to H0 or H1 depending on whether `beta_x==0` so that we can see the effect on risks alpha and beta.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Expand here for `df_pval` code\"}\ndf_pval =\n  sim_all %>% \n  rowwise() %>% \n  mutate(sim = summarise(sim, across(ends_with(\"_p\"), ~{\n    x = prop.test(sum(.x<0.05), length(.x))\n    tibble(mean=x$estimate, mean_check=mean(.x<0.05), inf=x$conf.int[1], sup=x$conf.int[2])\n  }))) %>% \n  unnest(sim) %>% \n  unpack(everything(), names_sep=\"_\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(matches(\"_p_\"),\n               names_pattern=c(\"m_(.*)_(.)_p_(.*)\"), \n               names_to=c(\"model\",\"term\",\".value\"),\n               names_transform=\\(x) paste0(\"pval_\", x),\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    type2 = factor(type, levels=c(\"no_bias\", \"confounding\", \"collider\"),\n                   labels=c(\"No bias\", \"Confounder\", \"Collider\")),\n    model2 = factor(model, levels=c(\"pval_bare\", \"pval_adju\"),\n                    labels=c(\"Bare model\", \"Adjusted model\")),\n    scenario = paste(type2, model2, sep=\" - \") %>% fct_rev(),\n    hypothesis = ifelse(beta_x==0,\"H0\", \"H1\"),\n    effect_z = paste0(\"Coef(Z)=\",beta_z)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Error on `p-values`-driven decisions: confusion bias\n\nAs we observed above, the confusion bias depends on the correlation between `X` and `Z` and on the strength of the effect of `Z`, Coef(Z).\n\nLet's plot the proportion of significant values (alpha=5%) for `X` when Coef(X)=0 (H0) and when Coef(X)=0.2 (H1), and see how it depends on those variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_pval %>%\n  filter(term==\"pval_x\") %>% #we don't really care about Z significance\n  filter(sample_size==500) %>% #these sims were made on N=500 only\n  filter(scenario==\"Confounder - Bare model\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=correlation, y=pval_mean, ymin=pval_inf, ymax=pval_sup, color=factor(beta_z))) +\n  geom_pointrange(size=0.3) + geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~hypothesis) +\n  # facet_grid(hypothesis~beta_z) + #this plot is nice too\n  labs(x=\"Correlation between X and Z\", y=\"Proportion of p-value<0.05 for X coefficient\", \n       color=\"Coef(Z)\") +\n  guides(color=guide_legend(nrow=1,byrow=TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-pval-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe dots and whiskers represent the proportion of significant values over the 1000 simulations and its very small 95% confidence interval.\n\n**Under H0 (left panel)**, when Coef(Z)=0, i.e. when there is no confusion bias, the proportion of significant values is stable at 5%. This is expected from the pre-specified alpha, and serves as internal validation. Then, the more you increase Coef(Z) and Cor(X,Z), the more false positives you get: the alpha risk increases.\n\n**Under H1 (right panel)**, when Coef(Z)=0, the proportion of significant values is stable at a value that represents the power of the test when there is no confusion bias. Then, the more you increase Coef(Z) and Cor(X,Z), the more true positives you get: the test is overpowered. Of course this is a far less problematic issue than the one above.\n",
